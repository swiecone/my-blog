        <h3 >In this article I explain how to work with users to really understand their needs, frustrations and aspirations, and integrate all the information in the products we are working on. </span></h3>
        <br>
        What I&rsquo;ve recently seen is that in the startup world there is real &ldquo;data worship&rdquo;. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t listen to what customers have to say, just look at the data. Customers are always lying. </span>

        <span class="c0">The truth is that data can tell us many things that are happening in our products, like where our conversion funnels are breaking up, if a new feature is giving the predicted results, or if the call to action button should be red or green. </span><p class="c10"><span class="c3 c17"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3 c17"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">The thing that data analytics does not do is connect emotionaly with your users, and get to really understand their deep needs that are not being met by our products.</span></p><p class="c2 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">In this article I&rsquo;ll go through some of the tactics I&rsquo;ve used to better understand customers at Careershifters.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.l6zus1dqf0p9"><span class="c8">First, you MUST know who your customers are (and who they are not)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">The worst error you can do is get the wrong customers to test your products. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Seriously, if you are testing video games, don&rsquo;t bring bring a 40 year old mum to talk about that game, even if you saw she purchased it on the shop. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">In Careershifters it would make no sense to get students who have not started their career, or are about to retire.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hope you get the point, and make sure you don&rsquo;t get into your offices the wrong profile </span><span class="c0 c12">because you did not find your &ldquo;perfect customer&rdquo;.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.f9sdukv1m0w"><span class="c8">Find your </span><span class="c3 c6">Power User (your evangelist)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">If you find your evangelist customer, you will have hit jackpot. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Those users are so desperate to find a solution for their own personal problem they will not mind to pay for the product even if it sometimes breaks down. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c22">DISCLAIMER:</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;In Careershifters not only did they find their Power User, but also they converted him into their Head of Product! :) </span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.n4d7tji8gce9"><span class="c8">Have an open and honest conversation</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having a call with your users is the best way to empathise with them</span><span class="c3 c0">. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Let them talk freely about their experience with the product, and just listen and look for patterns , and you will be having real &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment as you see how many product blindspots start to emerge. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If done well, I&rsquo;m sure you will have more than one moment when you think </span><span class="c14 c0 c12">&ldquo;how could I have missed THIS&rdquo;!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Housekeeping Before and After the Interview</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some tips on how to organise your calls</span></p><ol class="c16 lst-kix_thckuts990qr-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Review profile of customer: </span><span class="c3 c0">If the customer has used your product, check if you can get more detail to understand the person you will be talking to. </span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Doing video helps:</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;Words talk , but they miss facial expressions and feelings that could be expressed by your customers. If possible, do video.</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Record the call, and ask for consent:</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;Make sure you record the call, but first ask for consent, and make sure you record again so the consent is captured in the recording</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Always make open questions:</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;Starting with &ldquo;Did you like the product&rdquo; is always a BAD start for the interview. &nbsp;Let the person interviewed talk and make sure they understand they can be open and say whatever comes to their mind. &nbsp;Good questions could be &ldquo;What part of the product worked for you?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What part of the product did not work?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Two people in the interview is better than one:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;One person will be engaging with the person interviewed, while the other will be taking notes and observing the interaction. </span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Interview a minimum of 5 customers:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;After 5 customers are interviewed, you will start to see patterns and things that could be improved will start to emerge extremely clearly </span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Review the interview at the end:</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;If 2 people attend the interview, discuss about what each one got from the interview. &nbsp;If you were doing the interview alone, hear the recording and get insights. </span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Review previous interviews too:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The goal is to get patterns. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t find them, hear previous interviews. </span></li></ol><h2 class="c5" id="h.b6udy395cyc"><span class="c8">Make surveys before, during and after the product is used. </span></h2><p class="c2 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><ul class="c16 lst-kix_kvkpy3a4mrup-0 start"><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Before the user joins,</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;get some basic information from him so you understand the basics from the person that is joining your service, and how did they engage with your product</span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">During the time the user is engaged in your product,</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;do your best to get their feedback from time to time. </span></li><li class="c2 c11"><span class="c1">Always ask why the customer is leaving your product</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;This information will give you good understanding of what you are doing wrong, and how could the product be improved. </span></li></ul><h2 class="c5" id="h.bkdz2pdn3kib"><span class="c8">See how customers engage with your products</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">If you can, check how users use your products. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">You could make an intense check of what your user does on his day to day. Another way could be to grant permission from the customer to track his behaviour by monitoring his computer or mobile while using your product. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The goal is to understand how customers engage with your products.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">If you are lucky, you will be surprised with behaviours you could not have predicted. </span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.ibge2d5k9efn"><span class="c8">Analyse results and prioritise features that solve the problem on your roadmap </span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">If you follow the simple rules pointed out in this article, you WILL discover things to improve the customer experience. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">It&#39;s important to step back and get perspective to prioritise the most urgent features needed and put them at the top so they are developed first. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If possible, check the monetary impact of each feature, and put that first. &nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.jrs33rrd2t2w"><span class="c8">Create features that you think will solve the problems found</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Once you have the interviews done and dusted, you really need to sit down, prioritise, and then define the features that will solve the problems you found on the interviews. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On top of the feature, and even more important, is to </span><span class="c0 c12">define the hypothesis you have around how the feature will solve the problem. </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;On top of the hypothesis, you need to define how you will test and measure the hypothesis, and how you will know if the hypothesis was correct or wrong. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c12 c14">This is a good moment to switch to analytics, which will help you measure if the hypothesis is accurate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Integrate the customer interviews in your funnel</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">If you don&rsquo;t integrate customer interview in your funnel, you will not have the time to make it happen, there will always be other priorities. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Integrate this communication with customers in the funnel, and that will ensure you that the interview is done. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">An example of this service comes from ZOOM. &nbsp;When you join the service, they send an email inviting you to have a 1.2.1 call to ask questions you may have regarding the service. </span></p><p class="c2 c18"><span class="c14 c15 c12"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.xnt40xcmulqz"><span class="c8">Sometimes users don&rsquo;t have the answer</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Users will point things that are not working for them, or ideas they may have to improve the product. Feedback is great, and it helps us adapt our product. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In many occasions the product that is needed cannot be seen by customers, and it&rsquo;s your role to make it happen and then check with customers if your vision actually helps them. </span></p><p class="c2 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p>

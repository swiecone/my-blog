Are you working remotely and find it difficult to concentrate and get things done? Do you feel your day goes and don't have a clue of where the hours went?

Mindfulness is here to help you get focused and not distracted with minutia.

From conversations with remote workers, I've seen the biggest challenges are:
<ul>
    <li>At home you have a lot of distractions that can make get you distracted on the work to be done</li>
    <li>Not being able to distinguish clearly work from personal life</li>
    <li>Wasting time and finding out at the end of the day no work has been done</li>
</ul>
My personal experience with Mindfulness has been that it enables to be more conscious of how the mind "flies away" and how to get it back to the present moment.  On top of the many benefits it has on my day to day life, I've realised that Mindfulness is also helping get more work done faster and with less distractions when working remotely.

Some examples are:
<ul>
    <li>In the past I could jump from one page to another page to another page, and after a couple of hours feel guilty I lost my time without work being done.  With Mindfulness, when the process of jumping from one place to another in the internet comes, it's easier to detect the pattern and stop it, and go back to my daily to do list</li>
    <li>In the past multi tasking was something that happened regularly.  Trying to attend a meeting while answering mails and checking personal whatsapp.  Not any more.  Mindfulness teaches to focus on one thing at a time, and not let the mind get into too many things at the same time.</li>
    <li>Monitor emotions and not take them too seriously.   In the past I could get caught in emotional turmoil, I can detect if faster and get out faster.</li>
</ul>
If you think you don´t have time for Mindfulness, think twice, and make time for Mindfulness.  The remaining of your day after the practice will have more focus, clarity and presence.

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                <strong><p>Want to get in touch with me? </p></strong>

                I love getting emails with questions, comments or anything that goes through your mind. Please send me an email to <u><a href="mailto:alex@alexswiec.com">alex@alexswiec.com</a></u><br>

                <br>If I don't reply, feel free to forward me the same exact original email requesting my response,  adding  <i>"PLEASE REPLY"</i> at the beginning of the subject. Also try to get in tough through LinkedIn, Facebook, twitter, github or Medium (links below). <p>The thing is that sometimes mails do get lost in my inbox, and that has nothing to do with me ignoring your email!</p>  
                Thanks,<br><br>
                Alex

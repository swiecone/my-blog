            Thanks for taking the time to check my web!
            <p>
            What you see is a personal challenge of developing my own site (you can also call it blog, whatever works best for you). I'm more than happy if you want to <a href="https://github.com/swiecone/my-blog"> use the code  </a> to create your own thing.  Can't promise it's nice and neat, but what I can promise is that what you see is what you will get ;)
            </p>
            <p>
            In here I talk about <a title="about.html" href=" about.html">who I am </a>.  This is, from a professional point of view, as I'm still in exploration of who I really am! 

            <p>
           You can also check out what I'm currently focus on <a href=" now.html"> now</a> (thanks Derek Sivers for the "now" idea).  

           <p> 
            Other sections of the page are things are a collection of <a href="learning.html"> learnings </a> and stuff I write in the form of <a href="blog.html"> posts </a> 
            <p>
            If there is anything you want to tell me, just <a title="contact form" href=" contact.html">get in touch</a> or drop me a <a href="mailto:alex@alexswiec.com?subject=Hello from Alex's Web Site"> mail </a>
            </p>             
            <p>
            Love,

                <p>I believe in continuous education, and I have my <a href="https://trello.com/b/IV1Y1iUP/what-i-m-learning">Study Roadmap</a> inside a Trello Board. </p>

                <p>I'm currently learning the following:</p>
                <ul>
                      <li><strong>Questionnaire Design Michigan University:</strong> Learing how to cover the basic elements of designing and evaluating questionnaires. </li>
                      <br>
                      <li><strong>Reading Sprint:</strong> A book written by people in Google Ventures on how to solve big problems and test new ideas in just five days</li><br>
                      <li><strong>Learning how to Learn:</strong> This course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. We’ll learn about the how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”) information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.
                      </li>
                      <br>

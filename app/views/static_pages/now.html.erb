                <p> This section exists thanks to <a href="http://www.sivers.org", target = "blank">Derek Sivers</a> and his call to action when launching the <a href="http://nownownow.com/about", target = "blank">now</a> proposal, so I just wanted to send him a virtual high five from the now section of my site.</p>


                <p> The word <strong>Now </strong> is something that has an extremely important meaning for me thanks to the learnings from Eckhart Tolle and his books <i>"The Power of Now"</i> and <i>"A New Earth"</i>. Although I find Eckhart's work fascinating, the  goal of this section is not to talk about being in the Now, but rather present personal projects I'm currently working on. 

                <p> Every month I will update this page of the site   You can also see <i><a href="/historicnow.html">historical nows</a></i>.  You can also find more detailed information related with what I'm learning on the<i><a href= "learning.html"> learning section of the site</a></i>.  </p>
